"Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?"

I am interested in taking Cmsc320 as I felt that this is a very useful class in understanding 
the fundamentals of data science. CMSC320 builds a solid foundation of knowledge that 
one can then build upon to get farther into the field of data science. Additionally, I 
am a computer science major with a business analytics minor and I feel that this class 
perfectly involves these two fields of studies. It shows me how these two discplines can 
work together.
